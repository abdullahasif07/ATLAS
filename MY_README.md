Progress

•	Fixed dependencies issues by setting up an environment with python 3.7.7 and used that for all experiments.
•	Was able to figure out whole folder/file structure and pipeline
•	Was able to preprocess logs
•	Preprocessed logs, generated graph and then through graph_reader.py generated sequence graph
•	First had to generate sampled datasets by setting variables in atlas.py
•	Then train using sampled datasets
•	Then testing and evaluation

Issues

•	Dot issue while parsing; got fixed using Jaffer’s files.
•	Had to copy paste files from paper_experiments folder.
•	Graph generation, sampling and training take the most time
•	Getting 0 FPs and FNs on repeated attempts 
•	Syntax errors in multi hosting attacks and unclear file structure and their usage in paper_experiments folder. Not mentioned anything in readme.
