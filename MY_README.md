Progress

•	Fixed dependencies issues by setting up an environment with python 3.7.7 and used that for all experiments.

•	Was able to figure out whole folder/file structure and pipeline

•	Was able to preprocess logs

•	Preprocessed logs, generated graph and then through graph_reader.py generated sequence graph

•	First had to generate sampled datasets by setting variables in atlas.py

•	Then train using sampled datasets

•	Then testing and evaluation

•	Fixed syntax errors in multipreprocess and ran file successfully.




Issues

•	Dot issue while parsing; got fixed using Jaffer’s files.

•	Had to copy paste files from paper_experiments folder.

•	Graph generation, sampling and training take the most time

•	Difference in predicted entities.

•	Getting 0 FPs and FNs on repeated attempts 

•	Syntax errors in multi hosting attacks and unclear file structure and their usage in paper_experiments folder. Not mentioned anything in readme. 
  

•	Python 2 syntax found in multi hosting files such as xrange, f.next() so had to replace with Python 3's.


Others

•	Posted issue on gtithub regarding 0 FP and FN.
